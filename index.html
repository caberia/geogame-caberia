    <h1>Welcome to the "Finding US States" game</h1>

    <div class="instructions">
        <p>The game is pretty straightforward:</p>

        <br>

        <p>- I give you a blank map of US states and want you to find and click to a specific state.</p>

        <p>- You have <strong>1.5 Minutes</strong> to find as many states as possible.</p>

        <p>- If you click the wrong state, you don't lose lives, but you lose precious time!</p>

        <p>- Try to get the highest score before the time runs out.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Good luck.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Note: The game also includes the territories of the United States alongside the states.</p>
