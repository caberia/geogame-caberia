    <h1>Welcome to the "Finding US States" game</h1>

    <div class="instructions">
        <p>The game is pretty straightforward:</p>

        <br>

        <p>-I give you a blank map of US states and want you to find and click to a specific state.</p>

        <p>-If you give a correct answer, the game goes on.</p>

        <p>-If you can't, you lose 1 life.</p>

        <p>-You have 3 lives in total.</p>

        <p>-If you lose all of your lives, the game ends.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Good luck.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Note: The game also includes the territories of the United States alongside the states.</p>
